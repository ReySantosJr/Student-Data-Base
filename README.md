# Student-Data-Base

An iterator and Recursive Program that is a database that stores and manages student information. 

This program mirrors a database program for a school that stores and retrieves student information.
This project was made for my CMIS 242 class in UMGC.

The user can input and store a student's ID number, name, and major. And then the user has the option to delete, find and or update the student's classes, grade, and GPA.

A jar file is already provided for the user to start.
