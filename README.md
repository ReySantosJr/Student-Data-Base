# Student-Data-Base

 Program Name: Iterator and Recursive Program
 Program Purpose: 
 A database that stores and manages student information. 
 
This program mirrors a database program for a school that stores and retrieves student information.
This project was made for my CMIS 242 class in UMGC.

The user can input and store a student's ID number, name, and major. And then the user has the option to delete, find and or update the student's classes, grade, and GPA.
